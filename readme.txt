A block for calculating personal income tax in Bangladesh for FY 2025-2026. Users enter their information (including age, gender, third gender/freedom fighter/disabled status, and income/investment details), and the block provides a full breakdown of tax due, including rebates and progressive slab calculations.

== Description ==

This block helps users easily estimate their annual personal tax liability according to Bangladesh's latest 2025-2026 income tax rules. The block collects key profile and financial information, applies appropriate exemption thresholds, computes tax across all defined slabs, automatically accounts for special statuses (e.g. women, senior citizens, third gender, freedom fighters, persons with disabilities), and applies the investment-based tax rebate logic as required.

The breakdown includes the total income, exemption, taxable income, tax due per slab, total before rebate, eligible rebate, and net tax after rebate.
